# HazardHighway
Hazard Highway is a game concept I created on top of Nemi Chand's repository while researching, 
learning, and playing with Angular 5, SignalR, and Dotnet core. 

About the technology

Technology kudos to Nemi Chand's - Getting Started With SignalR Using ASP.NET Core And Angular, which certainly got me started.

About the Game

Hazard Highway is a game full of bad & inattentive drivers who desperately need your help. Swerve in front of them to enable their car's safety features before they crash! Can you help avoid the next pile up?
