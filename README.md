# HazardHighway
Hazard Highway is a game concept I created on top of Nemi Chand's repository while researching, 
learning, and playing with the interaction between Angular 5, SignalR, and Dotnet core. 

About the technology

Major Technology Credits to Nemi Chand's - Getting Started With SignalR Using ASP.NET Core And Angular, which certainly got me started.

About the Game

Hazard Highway is full of bad drivers who need your help!!
Swerve in front of the inattentive drivers to enable their safety features. 
Can you save them before they cause a huge pileup? Press Start and use your keyboard's arrow keys to control your car!!
